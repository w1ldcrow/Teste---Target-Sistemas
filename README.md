## Target Systems Job Application Test

This repository contains the solution to the coding test conducted as part of the job application process for Target Sistemas. The test involved developing a JavaScript function to reverse a given string without using any built-in methods.

## Description

The test task required the implementation of a JavaScript function named `reverseString(str)`, which takes a string as input and returns the reversed version of the string without using any built-in string reversal functions.

The function iterates over each character of the input string from the last character to the first character and concatenates them to build the reversed string. The solution is implemented in JavaScript.

## Test Completion

The test was successfully completed by developing the required function and ensuring its correctness through testing with various input strings. The solution adheres to the provided requirements and does not use any built-in string reversal methods.

## Repository Structure

- `reverseString.js`: JavaScript file containing the implementation of the `reverseString` function.
- `README.md`: Readme file providing instructions on how to use the `reverseString` function and describing the contents of the repository.

## Usage

To use the `reverseString` function, simply include the `reverseString.js` file in your project and call the function with a string argument to get its reversed version.

```javascript
let reversedString = reverseString("Hyago Bitencourt");
console.log(reversedString); // Output: truotnetciB ogaayH
